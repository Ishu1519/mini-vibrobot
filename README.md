## What Is This?

Most robots use multiple motors, wheels, or servos to steer. This project does it with **one motor** and **pure software**.

A single coin ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) motor — the flat pancake type from phone vibration alerts — is mounted at a 20-30° tilt on a chassis the size of a postage stamp. The tilt is critical: it converts vertical vibration into a directional horizontal force. By controlling **when** the motor spins clockwise vs counterclockwise, and **for how long**, the robot can:

- Move **forward** (rapid CW↔CCW switching)
- Curve **right** (sustained CW)  
- Curve **left** (sustained CCW)
- **Stop** (motor off)

All controlled wirelessly over **BLE 5.0** from a phone.

## 📐 How It Works

### The Stick-Slip Principle

When the ERM motor spins, the eccentric mass creates a rotating centrifugal force. Because the motor is **tilted at an angle** (30–45°), this force has two components:

```
    Coin ERM Motor (tilted 20-30° above chassis)
         _____
        /  ○  \   ← coin motor (flat pancake, 10mm dia)
       /________\
          ╱ ← tilt angle 20-30°
         ╱
━━━━━━━━╱━━━━━━━━━━  ← chassis (2cm × 2cm)
●   ●   ●   ●   ●   ← pen nib contacts (pentagon)
```

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Slip** | Horizontal force > static friction → robot slides forward |
| **Stick** | Force drops below friction → robot holds position |
| **Net result** | Robot crawls forward one tiny step per vibration cycle |

### Steering Without a Second Motor

This is the key insight. When the ERM spins **clockwise**, the rotating force vector sweeps in one direction, creating a **yaw torque** bias — the robot curves right. Reverse to **counterclockwise** and the yaw torque mirrors — robot curves left.

Rapid CW↔CCW switching cancels the yaw torques out → straight line.

```
Sustained CW  →  curves RIGHT  ↷
Sustained CCW →  curves LEFT   ↶
Rapid CW/CCW  →  STRAIGHT      ↑
```

## 🔬 The Physics

### Simple Version

The eccentric mass spins in a circle. That spinning creates a centrifugal force that pushes the robot. The tilt angle decides which direction the push goes.

### Full Mathematical Treatment

#### 1. Centrifugal Force

$$F_c = m_e \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r$$

Where:
- $m_e$ = eccentric mass (kg)
- $\omega = \frac{2\pi \cdot \text{RPM}}{60}$ = angular velocity (rad/s)
- $r$ = eccentricity (distance of mass from center, m)

For a 4mm ERM at ~12,000 RPM:
$$\omega = \frac{2\pi \times 12000}{60} \approx 1257 \text{ rad/s}$$

#### 2. Force Decomposition (Tilted Motor)

$$F_{\text{vertical}} = F_c \cdot \cos(\theta)$$
$$F_{\text{horizontal}} = F_c \cdot \sin(\theta)$$

At tilt angle $\theta = 25°$ (coin ERM optimal):
- $F_h = F_c \cdot \sin(25°) \approx 0.423 \cdot F_c$ (propulsion)
- $F_v = F_c \cdot \cos(25°) \approx 0.906 \cdot F_c$ (modulates normal force)

> **Note:** Coin ERM vibrates primarily in the Z-axis when flat. The 20-30° tilt converts this into a usable horizontal propulsion component. **Never mount flat — it kills directional control.**

#### 3. Stick-Slip Condition

Robot moves only when horizontal force exceeds static friction:

$$F_c \cdot \sin(\theta) > \mu_s \cdot (Mg - F_c \cdot \cos(\theta))$$

Solving for minimum ω:

$$\omega_{\min} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_s \cdot Mg}{r(sin\theta + \mu_s \cos\theta) \cdot m_e}}$$

**Physical meaning:** Too slow = robot just sits there vibrating. Above $\omega_{\min}$ = robot moves.

#### 4. Net Displacement Per Cycle

$$\Delta x = \frac{(F_h - \mu_k \cdot N) \cdot t_{\text{slip}}^2}{2M}$$

Where $N = Mg - F_c\cos(\theta)$ is the reduced normal force during slip phase.

#### 5. Optimal CW↔CCW Switching Frequency

The motor needs time to reach full speed before reversing:

$$f_{\text{opt}} = \frac{1}{2\tau_m}$$

where $\tau_m \approx 50\text{–}100\text{ ms}$ for a 4mm ERM, giving:

$$f_{\text{opt}} \approx 2\text{–}4 \text{ Hz} \quad (250\text{–}500\text{ ms per phase})$$

**Confirmed by SimoBot:** 500ms CW / 500ms CCW produced straight-line motion.

#### 6. Yaw Torque (Steering)

$$\tau_{\text{yaw}} = F_c \cdot d_{\text{offset}}$$

Where $d_{\text{offset}}$ is lateral distance from motor to chassis centroid. Reversing $\omega$ direction reverses $\tau_{\text{yaw}}$ sign → opposite curve direction.

#### 7. Power Budget

|--------|-------------|-------|
| Battery energy | 80mAh × 3.7V | 296 mWh |
| HT7737C boost | 3.7V → 5V at ~85% eff | ~4.25V output |
| CP6208 drop | 1.0–1.6V at 100mA | Motor gets ~2.6–3.4V |
| Motor current | ~80–120mA | — |
| BL602 BLE | ~15–20mA | — |
| Total draw | ~100–140mA peak | — |
| Runtime estimate | 80mAh ÷ 120mA | ~40 min |

> **Critical mounting note:** Coin ERM must be tilted 20-30° off horizontal. Flat mounting = only vertical vibration = no steering, weak locomotion. The tilt is the entire physics basis of the project.
